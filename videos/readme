I've captured the videos with Kazam and the converted them with
    ffmpeg -i random.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 18 ~/Desktop/random.mp4
because the originals were not playable in github.

To add a video to README.md, edit it in the github webpage (pencil) and
then drag and drop = upload into github special space and write the web address.
